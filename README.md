# Advent of Code 2022

I'm super late to this. Just knocking a few out in preparation for 2023's Advent of Code.

So far, I've completed the first day's challenge using Rust, and I think I came to a pretty reasonable solution. I've verified that the answer is valid as well. I know the Rust version can be improved though, and I'd like to improve it. Don't tell me the answer, I wish to find it myself.

I also want to get a few done in OCaml since that's a language I'm interested in. Weirdly, it feels like OCaml is making me a bit better at Rust.
